# Automation System – P&ID Project

## Overview
This project is a P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) created in AutoCAD. It represents the schematic layout of an automated industrial process, showing how equipment, instruments, and control devices are connected and interact.

## Contents
- P&ID drawing (.dwg) with complete symbol-based process representation
- Instruments, valves, sensors, and controllers properly labeled
- Signal and process flow connections between components
- Tagging and naming conventions based on standard practices

## Objectives
- Visualize the control and measurement system for an industrial process
- Practice designing a process instrumentation layout using AutoCAD
- Apply knowledge of automation, industrial processes, and technical diagramming

## Tools & Standards
- AutoCAD (P&ID module or symbol libraries)
- ISA/ISO standard P&ID symbols
- Basic automation control logic (sensors, actuators, PLC input/output)
